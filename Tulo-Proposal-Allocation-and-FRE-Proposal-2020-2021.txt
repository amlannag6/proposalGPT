TULO PROPOSAL - DELIVERABLES 
PROPOSED WORK AND STRATEGY
The Tulo Centre received $799k in funding to complete several deliverables listed in the table below.  The table includes the deliverable, a brief description of the work and suggested responsibilities to ensure this work gets completed.  It also includes some ideas that are not specific deliverables but would hep position the Tulo Centre for expansion and greater funding support next fiscal year.

It is important to note that in support of this work some planning materials have already been completed:
* Curriculum Explainer Videos - List of anticipated explainer videos has been completed but may continue to be updated.
* 165 - Distance version of course completed
* 166 - Distance version of course completed
* 263 - Distance version complete
* New Textbook - Textbook planning table and Textbook overview note are completed. 
Strategies
There are at least four next strategic steps for the consideration of the Tulo Centre to utilize these resources: 
1. Resource Allocation - The Tulo Centre should allocate resources to complete the work, increase demand and build the necessary capacity to meet this anticipated demand (see point 3).  It is proposed that contracts be used as much as possible to complete this work until the Tulo Centre has multi-year funding in place from CIRNA, ISC, the FNTC and potentially others.  There are two approaches to allocating contractor resources - proposal based or Tulo specified.  It is probably best to seek proposals from FR, Joy Factory, Julie Holloway, and a few others to support the resource allocation process and allocate remaining resources as required. 
2. Textbook development - The new textbook is intended to reach a much wider audience and position the Tulo Centre for the emerging education framework - more distance learning interaction.  It is proposed that this requires more learning games and resources to support the development of those games.  The Tulo Centre should consider a staged release of the textbook such as 2 or 3 chapters at a time. 
3. Showcase Distance Course - The development of 263 has provided significant material to develop a short on-line course as a showcase for Tulo Centre materials to government and potential funders.  It could be based on the first chapter of the textbook - the impact of pandemics and the requirements for a more resilient economy.  It could also use the game as an evaluation tool. 
4. Capacity Development - The Tulo Centre should establish the necessary capacity to support greater distance learning (IT, server, classroom studio, alumni network etc.), greater support for Indigenous institution development (stats, social media, research, etc.) and long-term funding stability (proposals, fund raising, accountability frameworks, corporate plan, etc.). There should be a separate resource allocation strategy for long-term Tulo Centre capacity development.  In particular, the Tulo Centre should seek proposals from preferred contractors to develop this capacity.  These proposals and those from the contractors used to meet the deliverables should form the Tulo Centre resource allocation strategy.
