Tulo Centre short- and medium-term work plan to support the First Nations Fiscal Management Act (FMA) COVID-19 response and economic recovery strategy
Overview
The Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics is a not-for-profit educational and research centre focussed on building administrative capacity to implement Indigenous government jurisdictions that build sustainable Indigenous economies. The Tulo Centre has worked closely with the First Nations Fiscal Management Act (FMA) institutions (especially the First Nations Tax Commission [FNTC]) and most recently the First Nation Land Management Resource Centre (RC) to develop and deliver accredited curriculum, workshops and specialized training; conduct economic, historical and education research; advance institutional innovations; and create and deliver new innovative workshops, webinars, and programs on topical subjects. Over 300 Indigenous students have attended Tulo Centre courses and programs. Over 2,000 Indigenous, federal, provincial and local public servants have attended or participated in Tulo Centre workshops and webinars. An overview of the Tulo Centre is attached to this proposal. 
Tulo Centre alumni are from over 200 First Nations across Canada. The Tulo Centre is aware of the immediate health, economic and fiscal impacts of COVID-19 in these communities. The Tulo Centre proposes to work closely with the FNTC and possibly the other FMA institutions and the federal government to support their COVID-19 short-term response strategy and medium-term rapid economic recovery plan. The Tulo Centre has identified projects that it can undertake in both areas:
1.	Support for short-term mitigation strategies for tax collecting and other FMA First Nations – This will include communications, research, information sharing, podcasts, workshops, webinars and courses for taxing and FMA First Nations.
2.	Building Administrative Capacity for a faster recovery – This will involve expanding the Tulo Centre distance education capacity to deliver more training, education, research and workshops to more First Nations. 
Tulo Centre Support for Immediate COVID-19 Mitigation Strategies 
The Tulo Centre proposes the development and online (distance) delivery of at least the following services to support effective implementation of COVID-19 immediate mitigation strategies. Since all these services will be conducted at a distance, the Tulo Center will record and update materials and estimates to better support the immediate mitigation strategies.
•	Understanding COVID-19 Impacts Workshop – This workshop would present some of the FMA work on economic and fiscal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an opportunity for First Nations and especially Tulo Centre alumni to share greater community impact details. It would also introduce possible mitigation programs and strategies and provide the schedule for future COVID-19 FMA workshops. The delivery of this workshop is expected to be 2 to 3 hours. 
•	Tax Administration Support – This would be oriented to First Nation tax administrators and provide information about the support the FNTC will provide to ensure that First Nation tax systems operate as effectively as possible. The delivery of this workshop is expected to be 2 to 3 hours.
•	Tax Deferrals, Service Agreements and Abatement – This workshop will depend on the design and implementation of FNTC-federal programs to support tax deferrals, service agreement payments and tax abatement programs. Delivery is expected to be a 2-3hours for this workshop.
•	Applied Economics 1650 (Communications and Taxpayer Relations) – This is the next scheduled course for the current accredited certificate program in First Nations Tax Administration. The Tulo Centre will convert this course into a virtual classroom and interactive learning experience. Tulo will also expand possible enrollment to any interested First Nation tax administrator. The content will be enhanced to include implementing deferral; tax abatement and interest and penalty programs; and communicating with taxpayers about these other COVID-19 mitigation programs. 
•	Building a More Sustainable Economy – This workshop will discuss some of the economic impacts of the pandemic and focus on the necessary elements to build a more sustainable Indigenous economy. Depending on resources, it is possible this workshop would feature the Tulo Centre’s digital version of its building a sustainable Tribal/First Nation Economy game. This is expected to be a 3 to 4hour workshop.
•	Renewing Indigenous Economies Podcast Series – The Tulo Centre will work with the Chief Commissioner of the FNTC and potentially other guests to develop a podcast series on the history of pre-contact indigenous economies, past pandemics, colonial economies and some strategies to renew and develop sustainable indigenous economies and governments after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
•	(Optional) Possible FMB Workshops on Financial Management Issues and Options – The Tulo Centre will work with the First Nations Financial Management Board (FMB) if requested to design and develop workshop(s) related to the many financial management issues that will arise related to the pandemic. Each of these workshops is expected to be 2 hours long. 
Workplan and Budget
The Tulo Centre anticipates the following six-part work plan to develop and deliver these webinars, workshops and courses in support of the immediate COVID-19 mitigation strategy for tax collecting and other FMA First Nations.
•	Distance capacity – The Tulo Centre will upgrade current distance online learning platforms which includes the Zoom online webinar system and the Moodle online learning system The Tulo Centre will also expand its digital studio to include higher performing equipment and software that supports additional use. In addition to the learning platforms, the Tulo Centre utilizes videos and podcasts to augment learning material. Another essential component is the ability for participants to connect with each other to learn from and support each other through discussion forums. The Tulo Centre will purchase Thinkific for improved workshops, upgrade its podcast and studio hardware and expand its adobe creative cloud license to ensure it can maintain its active learning success to distant learners.     
•	Design – Design is the most important part of the “Tulo Method”. Whenever a course or workshop is developed, we first look to collaborate to develop relevant learning objectives supported by activity-based learning with the specific audience. A preliminary outline of the workshop is then developed to inform a workshop planning table and the development of the workshop materials. Tulo then develops a more comprehensive workshop planning table that sets out the learning objectives, activities (with timeframes) and background resources for each module and sub-topic. The workshops are usually composed of three to six modules and three to six sub-topics based on the learning objectives and duration of the workshop. 
o	The activities are a mix of instruction, facilitated discussion, group work and activities such as games, briefings/pitches, case studies or scenarios. 
o	The background resources include the customized workshop manual, relevant readings, online resources, professional films / videos, and podcasts / audio resources. 
•	Development – Tulo Centre will develop the course content, online textbooks/resources, professional films/videos, short explainer videos, podcasts, and creation of virtual classroom/workshop environments to support webinars, workshops and courses as per the workshop or course design. The development of materials and activity content is the most time-consuming element of this workplan. 
•	Delivery– Workshop and courses will be delivered primarily through Tulo’s own Moodle platform. The Moodle platform provides significant delivery flexibility with video conference plugins like Zoom and BigBlueButton for instruction and direct interaction with participants; H5P and Kaltura for interactive activities and learning; and Adobe Creative Cloud for explainer videos, images and other content. Additionally, delivery will include professional original video and audio content for course topics, input into interactive course material or as supplementary resources. 
•	Evaluation – The Tulo Centre builds programs based on a continuous feedback loop. This process allows for improvement of programs, increase of participation and the ability to address issues efficiently. The Tulo Centre collects participant surveys and the instructor’s comments on engagement in activities to measure content effectiveness. This information is analyzed and the Tulo Centre develops, reviews and implements improvements. 
•	Administration and Marketing – The Tulo Centre will market the workshops to impacted First Nations, Tulo alumni and other potentially interested students. The Tulo Centre will also consider expanding participation in the distance version of APEC 165 to interested students because of its particular relevance to COVID-19 fiscal impacts and taxpayer relations. The Tulo Centre will also hire a administrative assistant and expand its audio visual and information technology support to ensure lower switching costs for Tulo instructors and students to the distance learning environment.
